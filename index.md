Hello! My name is Grace Hart (she/her) and I am an aspiring psychological scientist. I recently graduated from Boston College with a B.A. in psychology. I hope to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology, where I would like to use computational modeling to improve our understanding of the relationship between suicide, death beliefs/attitudes, and eudaemonic wellbeing. I am also interested in metascience, espeically theory-building and improving research methods/practices. In my free time, I enjoy reading and practicing yoga.
