Hello! My name is Grace Hart (she/her) and I am a Postgraduate Associate in Yale University's Psychology Department. I am currently the lab manager of Dr. Shirley Wang's [Computational Clinical Science Lab](https://ccslab.yale.edu/), where we leverage ecological momentary assessment and computational methods to study self-injurious thoughts and behaviors and eating disorder behaviors.

In the future, I intend to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology, during which I would like to use computational modeling and intensive longitudinal methods to improve our understanding of the relationship between suicide, beliefs and feelings about death ("death concepts"), and meaning in life. In short, I am passionate about leveraging new methods to answer perennial questions. I am also interested in metascience, espeically theory-building and measurement. In my free time, I enjoy reading and practicing yoga.
